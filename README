Easy metric lets you collect information about your build system, or any other automated process, easily. 

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=============

1. Install rails
2. Install Gruff gem (http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff)
3. Lauch the server.
    ruby script/server


CONFIGURE
=============

To start collecting data, simply create a new metric and assign it a key. The key will be used as an identifier when you push data to Easy Metric. Once you've added a metric, you can view the data in the main view. 


USAGE
=============

Pushing new data to a metric is as simple as a http GET request. Just use your favorite scripting language and make a request to http://YOUR_SERVER/push/your_key/data/your_value. Where your key is the name of the key you previously added and your_value is the value you want to add.
